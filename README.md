## Difference Between Typeface and Font

### Typeface  
A **typeface** is the overall design of a set of characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols. It defines the visual style of text, such as its shape, proportions, and distinguishing features. A typeface can have multiple variations, such as different weights, styles, and sizes.

#### Example:  
- **Helvetica** is a typeface.
- **Times New Roman** is a typeface.

### Font  
A **font** is a specific implementation of a typeface with a particular style, weight, and size. It is the actual file or physical medium used to display text in a given way.

#### Example:  
- **Helvetica Bold 12pt** is a font.
- **Times New Roman Italic 16pt** is a font.

### Key Difference  
- A **typeface** is the conceptual design, like a family of related styles.  
- A **font** is a specific instance of a typeface with defined attributes (weight, style, size).

#### Analogy  
Think of a **typeface** as a song and a **font** as a specific recording of that song in a certain key, tempo, and arrangement.
